                   <p>The vibrant coastal city of Vlora is a requisite stop for every tourist visiting Albania during the summer. <br>Vlora marks the boundary between two seas - the Adriatic and the Ionian - which, in turn, are simultaneously shared between three countries: <b>Albania, Greece, Italy</b>.</br> Boasting an enviably long and beautiful coastline, the ideal exploration of Vlora requires time and leisure. <br>One day does not suffice as the city includes too many beaches, sights and cultural monuments.</br>
